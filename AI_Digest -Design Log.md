## Evolution

### Change #1 (Jan 25th 2026)

**What Changed**: moved the date from yesterday's updates to fecthign data for past 2-3 weeks

**Why**: intially planned to get the date for the past 24 hours but it doesnt seem like i have a lot of data. so fetching the results for past 2-3 weeks.

**What I Learned**:

### Change #2 (Jan 25th 2026)

**What Changed**: topics, didn't like the topics, they are more about ai startups and that stuff, they are kinda generalized not relevant to what i actually wanted to see.

**Why**: so moving towards the topics like netflix tech docs or other redis docs and stuff.. linkedin posts and all the relevant articles that i find interesting... how the big tech companies or comapnies like redis handle the software problems or ai problems, how we imporve the comapnay as a team or moving towards ai stuff regualry ... more interested towards that rather then if they raised how many million money... or what the new ideas are about or if there any new papers related to open ai and that stuff...

**What I Learned**:
